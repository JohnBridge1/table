1. Athletics (Track & Field)
Para athletics uses T (track/jump) and F (field) classes.

T = running and jumping events (e.g., 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, 1500m, 5000m, marathon, long jump, triple jump, high jump).
F = throwing events (shot put, discus, javelin, club throw).
Classification Group	Codes	Impairment Type/Description	Typical Events
Vision Impairment	T11–T13, F11–F13	B1/B2/B3 in other sports; T11/F11 = no functional vision, T12/F12 & T13/F13 = progressively higher visual acuity. T classes for running/jumps, F for throws.	T11–13 for sprints to marathon & jumps (often with guide for T11, T12). F11–13 for shot, discus, javelin.
Intellectual Impairment	T20, F20	Athletes with an intellectual disability meeting IPC criteria.	T20 used in running/jumps (e.g., 400m, 1500m, long jump). F20 in shot put.
Coordination Impairments (Cerebral Palsy, etc.)	T32–T38, F31–F38	Wheelchair track classes T32–34 (severe impairment: racing chairs), ambulant T35–38 (milder, can run/jump). F31–34 seated throws, F35–38 standing throws.	T32–34 in wheelchair races. T35–38 in ambulant sprints, mid-distance, jumps. F31–34 in seated shot/discus/club, F35–38 in standing throws.
Short Stature	T40–T41, F40–F41	Dwarfism / short stature. T = running/jump, F = throws.	Track (sprints, up to 400m) or occasionally jumps for T40–41, field throws for F40–41 (shot put).
Limb Deficiencies (Standing)	T42–T47, F42–F46	Single/double above- or below-knee/arm amputations (no prosthesis or minimal aids). T for running/jumps, F for throws.	T42–44: leg amputation(s). T45–47: arm amputation(s). F42–46 for throws.
Prosthetic Running	T61–T64, F61–F64	Lower-limb amputees using prosthetic(s) for running (T) or throwing (F). Replaced older “T/F44–46” for some.	T61–64 for track (e.g., blade runners). F61–64 for javelin, discus, shot.
Wheelchair Racing (Spinal Cord / Polio, etc.)	T51–T54	T51 = most severe trunk/arm involvement, T54 = least. All use racing chairs on track.	100m up to marathon (T51–54). No jumps in wheelchair classes.
Wheelchair Field Throwing	F51–F57	Seated throws for more significant trunk/limb impairments.	Shot put, discus, javelin, club throw in a seated throwing frame. F51 = most severe trunk/arm involvement, up to F57 = mild.
2. Swimming
Para swimming classes have S (freestyle/backstroke/butterfly), SB (breaststroke), and SM (individual medley), each with a number indicating impairment severity or type:

Classification	Codes	Description	Typical Events
Physical Impairment (PI) – low to high function	S1–S10, SB1–SB9, SM1–SM10	Lower number = more severe impairment. Some swimmers may have different SB (breaststroke) class than S/SM due to stroke-specific limitations.	S = free/back/fly, SB = breast, SM = medley. For example, a swimmer might be S8, SB7, SM8.
Visual Impairment (VI)	S11–S13, SB11–SB13, SM11–SM13	B1/B2/B3 analog. S11 = no functional vision (blackened goggles, tappers), S12/S13 = partial vision.	Freestyle, back, fly = Sxx; breast = SBxx; medley = SMxx. E.g. S11 swimmers always wear opaque goggles and use tapper signals.
Intellectual Impairment	S14, SB14, SM14	Intellectual disabilities meeting IPC/World Para Swimming criteria.	Same strokes but class 14. For instance: 100m free S14, 100m breast SB14, 200m IM SM14.
3. Cycling

Tricycle (T)	T1–T2	Tricycles (road only)	Road races & time trials for balance/co-ordination impairments. T1 = more severe.
Cycle (C)	C1–C5	Standard 2-wheel bikes (modified)	Both road (RR & TT) and track (pursuit, time trial, scratch, etc.). C1 = severe impairment, C5 = least severe.
Tandem (B)	B	Tandem bike (pilot + stoker who is visually impaired)	Road & track for vision-impaired riders (B1–B3 combined). All “B” classes race together. E.g., tandem pursuit on track, tandem road race.
4. Paratriathlon
Current paratriathlon (PT) classes:

Classification	Codes	Description	Events
Wheelchair	PTWC (1 & 2 combined)	Athletes using a handcycle for bike leg and racing wheelchair for run. PTWC1 more severe, PTWC2 less. They race together with time factors.	Men’s PTWC, Women’s PTWC
Standing	PTS2, PTS3, PTS4, PTS5	Ambulatory athletes with leg/arm impairments of varying severity. Lower number = more significant impairment.	Men’s PTS2–5, Women’s PTS2–5 (each is a separate event)
Vision Impairment	PTVI (B1–B3 combined)	All levels of vision impairment, racing with a sighted guide (tethered run, tandem bike).	Men’s PTVI, Women’s PTVI
5. Archery

6. Shooting (Para Sport)
Two classes:

Classification	Code	Description	Events
SH1	SH1 (Rifle or Pistol)	Athletes who can support the firearm without a stand (impairment in legs or less severe arms). All pistol events are SH1 only.	10m Air Rifle (Standing or Prone), 50m Rifle, 10m/25m Pistol events. Separated by SH1 rifle vs. SH1 pistol.
