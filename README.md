## Notes on Event Grouping vs. Classification

- Some sports (athletics, swimming, table tennis) hold separate events for each or most classes.  
- Others (e.g., alpine skiing, Nordic skiing) group multiple classes into **one event category** (e.g., “Standing,” “Sitting,” “VI”) with a factoring system for results.  
- Team sports (goalball, football 5-a-side) do not separate by class once athletes meet minimal VI requirements.  
- Judo for VI combines B1–B3 in one weight category.  
- Powerlifting has no functional categories, just weight classes.
